The average gain for U.S. bonds during deflation was 9.45 percent, the highest of all observations under various regimes.\n\nConsidering the given knowledge points, it is implied that the return rate of bonds is negatively impacted by inflation and deflation. Inflation erodes the real return on bonds, and bonds are fixed-rate investments, meaning their returns are affected by changes in purchasing power due to inflation. Additionally, during deflation, U.S. bonds have shown a significant gain.\n\nSTATEMENT: The return rate of the bonds affected by inflation and deflation will decrease by 5%.\n[Supported]",
