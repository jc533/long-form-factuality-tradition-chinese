The McGill University Health Centre has a Department of Bariatric Surgery.\n\nNow, let's analyze the STATEMENT: \"The McGill University Health Centre's three main hospitals provide surgery.\"\n\nFrom the KNOWLEDGE, we can see that at least one of the hospitals (Montreal Children's Hospital) has a specific surgery department (Cardiovascular & Thoracic Surgery). Additionally, the McGill University Health Centre as a whole has a Department of Bariatric Surgery. Although the KNOWLEDGE does not explicitly state that all three main hospitals provide surgery, it implies that surgery is available at the McGill University Health Centre, and at least one of its hospitals has a specific surgery department.\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the McGill University Health Centre's hospitals likely provide surgery, even if the KNOWLEDGE does not explicitly state that all three main hospitals do so.\n\nSTATEMENT: The McGill University Health Centre's three main hospitals provide surgery.\n\nFinal answer: [Supported]", "answer": "Supported"}, "annotation": "Supported"}, {"sentence": "Its three main hospitals provide a range of healthcare services, from adult medicine and surgery to pediatric medicine and geriatric care.", "atomic_fact": "Its three main hospitals provide pediatric medicine.", "self_contained_atomic_fact": "The McGill University Health Centre's Montreal Children's Hospital provides pediatric medicine.", "relevance_data": {"atomic_fact": "Its three main hospitals provide pediatric medicine.", "revised_fact": "To revise the statement, we need to identify the subjects in the statement and determine whether they are vague references.\n\nThe statement is: \"Its three main hospitals provide pediatric medicine.\"\n\nThe subjects in the statement are \"Its\" and \"three main hospitals\". \n\n\"Its\" is a pronoun, which is a vague reference.

Therefore, \"Its\" should be replaced by \"The McGill University Health Centre's\".\n\n\"three main hospitals\" is also a vague reference, as it is unclear what three main hospitals are being referred to. From the RESPONSE, we can see that the three main hospitals are the Royal Victoria Hospital, the Montreal Children's Hospital, and the Montreal General Hospital. However, the statement only mentions that the three main hospitals provide pediatric medicine, which is specifically mentioned in the RESPONSE as a specialty of the Montreal Children's Hospital. Therefore, we can infer that the statement is referring to the three main hospitals of the McGill University Health Centre, but specifically the one that provides pediatric medicine is the Montreal Children's Hospital. However, since the statement does not make any claims about the other two hospitals, we can only replace \"three main hospitals\" with \"the McGill University Health Centre's hospitals\" or \"its hospitals\" to make it clear that the hospitals belong to the McGill University Health Centre.\n\nHowever, since the statement only mentions that the three main hospitals provide pediatric medicine, and from the RESPONSE we can see that only the Montreal Children's Hospital provides pediatric medicine, we can infer that the statement is referring to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
