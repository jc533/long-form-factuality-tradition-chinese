From the RESPONSE, we can see that Sarah Paoletti's research includes \"跨國婚姻\" which translates to \"cross-border marriage\" or more specifically \"transnational marriage\" or \"international marriage\". However, in this case, we can assume that \"cross-border marriage\" is referring to the same concept as \"跨國婚姻\" in the RESPONSE.\n\nBut, we can also see that \"跨國婚姻\" is part of a broader category of research areas that Sarah Paoletti is focused on, which includes \"移民法\" (immigration law), \"難民法\" (refugee law), \"移民政策\" (immigration policy), \"移民法律服務\" (immigration legal services), and \"移民制度\" (immigration system). Therefore, we can consider \"cross-border marriage\" as a specific example of Sarah Paoletti's research in the broader category of \"移民法\" (immigration law) or more specifically \"跨國婚姻\" (transnational marriage) as part of her research in \"移民法\" (immigration law).\n\nHowever, in this case, we can assume that \"cross-border marriage\" is not a vague reference because it is clear that it is referring to the research conducted by Sarah Paoletti in the area of \"跨國婚姻\" (transnational marriage).\n\nTherefore, the revised statement is:\n```\nSarah Paoletti's research includes cross-border marriage.\n```",
